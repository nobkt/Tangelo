"""Occupied orbital pair screening API for DLPNO-CCSD(T).

This module provides the entry point for constructing the retained occupied
orbital pair set Π according to the formal retention rule specified in
dev_notes/dlpno/pair_screening_skeleton.md (Phase2-Task2.1).

Key References from Skeleton Document:
    - Section 5 (Retention Rule): A pair (i,j) is retained iff i < j ∧ C(i,j) ≥ τ_pair
    - Section 7 (Invariants): Symmetry, idempotence, monotonicity, no hidden fallback
    - Section 8 (Prohibited): No heuristics, no dynamic relaxation, no stochastic sampling

Design Principles:
    - Pure API stub (no computational logic yet)
    - Returns empty list until implementation arrives in Phase2-Task2.4
    - No heuristics or fallback logic (prohibited by skeleton)
    - No NotImplementedError to avoid implying partial behavior

Future Tasks:
    - Task2.3: Add analytic specification document for coupling functional C(i,j)
    - Task2.4: Implement C(i,j) evaluation + populate Π with deterministic screening
    - Task2.5: Add validation hooks (assert_symmetry, recompute_and_diff, coverage_stats)

    """Construct the retained occupied orbital pair set Π.

    This is a stub implementation that returns an empty list. The full
    implementation will be provided in Phase2-Task2.4 after the coupling
    functional C(i,j) is formally specified in Phase2-Task2.3.

    Args:
        reference_wavefunction: RHF reference wavefunction object providing
            access to MO coefficients, orbital energies, and occupation pattern.
            Type is intentionally left as Any pending integration specification.
        threshold_symbol: Formal threshold symbol (default: "τ_pair").
            Actual numeric threshold interpretation deferred to Task2.4.

    Returns:
        PairSet: Empty list in stub form. Future implementation will return
            list of retained pairs (i,j) with i < j, ordered lexicographically.

    Notes:
        - No heuristics or fallback logic (prohibited by skeleton Section 8)
        - Returns [] instead of raising NotImplementedError to keep downstream
          imports safe during incremental development
        - Full retention rule: (i,j) ∈ Π ⇔ i < j ∧ C(i,j) ≥ τ_pair
        - Invariants (Section 7): symmetry, idempotence, monotonicity, no fallback
